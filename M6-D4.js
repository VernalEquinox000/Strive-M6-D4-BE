     MEDIUM PROJECT

     Today you continue building Medium API. 
     Backend needs to grant data persistance via MongoDB

     //BACKEND

     Your backend should now save authors in their own collection, therefore you should
     link articles to their corresponding author and you should have CRUD for authors.

     Complete past homework :)
     
     [EXTRAS]

     Claps system. 

    Claps should be an array of user ids that is attached on the article schema.
     Whenever you click on the clap button add the id of the user to that array. 
     Therefore you know if someone clapped or not by checking if it is in the array! 

      You can check length of array to get total claps , its simple!

    [EXTRA OF EXTRA] 


     Check how many YOU clapped! 
     and if you clapped make clap button blue :slight_smile:
